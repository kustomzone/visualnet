# VisualNet

Site visualization source repository for our bachelors' degree project, extended Dr Chuck's tutorials. Just enter the website domain you want to visualize, then other details (like #nodes to fetch) and so on. Wait for a while till the pages are crawled, and then witness the stunning visualization!
